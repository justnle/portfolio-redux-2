                I am a Full Stack Engineer based in <b>Seattle, WA</b>. I love
                to design and create applications that look as great as they are
                user-friendly. At the moment, TypeScript is my favorite
                language. I am currently freelancing and looking to contribute
                to the success of a team/company that is striving to make an
                impact on the world, no matter the size. Let's collaborate!

                Outside of the office, you can find me biking or working out at
                the gym.
