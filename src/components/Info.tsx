            <p>
                I am a Full Stack Engineer based in <b>Seattle, WA</b>. I love
                to design and create applications that look as great as they are
                user-friendly and TypeScript is my favorite language. I am
                currently taking on freelance projects and looking to contribute
                to the success of a team/company that is striving to make an
                impact on the world, no matter the size.

                Outside of the office, you can find me biking or at the gym
                working out!
